### Installing WP-CLI

Downloading the Phar file is the recommended installation method for most users. If you need other options, refer to the documentation on alternative installation methods such as Composer, Homebrew, or Docker.

#### Minimum Requirements

Before proceeding with the installation, ensure your environment meets these minimum requirements:

- **UNIX-like environment**: This includes OS X, Linux, FreeBSD, or Cygwin. Limited support is available for Windows environments.
- **PHP version**: 5.6 or later is required.
- **WordPress version**: Version 3.7 or later. Be aware that older versions may have limited functionality.

#### Downloading WP-CLI

Once you confirm your environment meets the requirements, you can download the `wp-cli.phar` file using either `wget` or `curl`.

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wp-cli/builds/gh-pages/phar/wp-cli.phar
```

#### Verifying the Installation

To ensure the downloaded Phar file works, execute a command to check its status. 

```bash
php wp-cli.phar --info
```


#### Making WP-CLI Accessible Globally

To run WP-CLI by simply typing `wp` in the command line, you'll need to make the file executable and move it to a directory included in your system's PATH.

#### Confirming the Installation

If everything has been set up correctly, running a command like `wp --info` will display details about your environment, including the operating system, PHP version, MySQL information, and WP-CLI version. This output provides a quick way to verify that WP-CLI is functioning properly. 

```bash
chmod +x wp-cli.phar
sudo mv wp-cli.phar /usr/local/bin/wp
```
